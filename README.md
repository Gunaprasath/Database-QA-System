# Inventory Management Using LLM
## Overview
Inventory Management Using LLM is an AI-driven solution designed to revolutionize inventory management in the retail sector. By integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Google PaLM with the LangChain framework and a robust MySQL backend, this project enables users to interact with inventory data using natural language queries. The system translates user questions into SQL commands, retrieves real-time data, and presents results through an intuitive Streamlit interface. This approach not only simplifies complex data retrieval but also enhances accessibility for both technical and non-technical users. The project demonstrates how advanced AI and automation can streamline operations, reduce manual effort, and provide actionable insights for smarter business decisions.
